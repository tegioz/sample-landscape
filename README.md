# Sample landscape

This is just a sample landscape generated with [cncf/landscape2](https://github.com/cncf/landscape2).

- The `main` branch contains the output of the `landscape2 new` command.
- The `build` branch contains the output of the `landscape2 build` command, which is served by GitHub Pages at <https://tegioz.github.io/sample-landscape>.
- The [build workflow](https://github.com/tegioz/sample-landscape/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml) buids the landscape and pushes the result to the `build` branch on every push to the `main` branch.
